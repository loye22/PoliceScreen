Title: UAE Police Guard Interview Assistant

Description:

The UAE Police Guard Interview Assistant is a cutting-edge GitHub app that revolutionizes the traditional paper-based approach for screening and interviewing security guards. Developed exclusively for the UAE Police Department, this app streamlines the process of evaluating and qualifying candidates for security guard positions, ensuring a more efficient and accurate selection process.

Key Features:

* Comprehensive Guard Management: The app seamlessly retrieves guard information from the backend system and categorizes them into three tabs: New, Renew, and Residual guards. This intuitive organization allows the police officers to efficiently navigate and manage a large pool of candidates.

* Dynamic Tabular Interface: Each tab within the app presents guards in a table format, providing an overview of their relevant details, such as personal information, qualifications, and availability. Officers can easily mark guards as Pass, Fail, Rejected, or Absent, ensuring a streamlined evaluation process.

* Search Functionality: The app includes a powerful search feature, enabling users to quickly locate specific guards based on various criteria, such as name, ID number, or qualification. This search functionality saves time and enhances the user experience by facilitating easy access to relevant candidate profiles.

* Digital Signatures: Prior to submitting the evaluation details, the app incorporates a digital signature feature that enables the responsible police officer to sign off on the evaluation. This enhances the authenticity and accountability of the assessment process.

* Statistical Insights: The app offers comprehensive statistics and insightful reports, empowering decision-makers with a clear overview of the evaluation outcomes. These reports highlight the number of guards who have passed, failed, been rejected, or marked as absent, along with additional batch-related information.

* Multi-User Support: The app supports up to three police officers as signatories, allowing for collaborative evaluations and ensuring the involvement of multiple stakeholders in the decision-making process.

* Notes and Rescheduling: The app allows officers to add notes to individual guard profiles, providing a convenient way to document important observations, remarks, or additional information. Additionally, officers have the ability to reschedule guards to a specific date, ensuring better organization and follow-up for future evaluations.
